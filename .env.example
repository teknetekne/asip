# ASIP Clawdbot Configuration (v2.0)

# --- Moltbook Authentication (REQUIRED) ---
# Get your token from: https://www.moltbook.com/settings/api
# Without this, you cannot join the clawdbot network
MOLTBOOK_TOKEN=your_moltbook_api_token_here

# --- ASIP Network Settings ---
# Swarm Topic (Default: asip-clawdbot-v1)
# All clawdbots use this topic to find each other
ASIP_TOPIC=asip-clawdbot-v1

# Minimum responses to wait for consensus (Default: 3)
# When you ask a question, at least this many bots must respond
ASIP_MIN_RESPONSES=3

# Response timeout in milliseconds (Default: 30000 = 30 seconds)
# How long to wait for responses before aggregating
ASIP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=30000

# --- Hall of Fame API (Optional) ---
# Set this to report winners to central leaderboard
# See api/ folder for setup instructions
HALL_OF_FAME_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com/api/winners

# --- Your LLM Provider (Not ASIP's concern) ---
# ASIP only handles messaging between clawdbots
# Each clawdbot uses its own LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
# Example:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
